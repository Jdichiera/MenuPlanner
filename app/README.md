Application Type: Android Mobile Application

Inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation are used throughout the application

Search functionality is displayed on the Dish and Ingredient Selection views

A SQLite database with CRUD functionality is used

Two reports can be generated from the Day Selection view

Exception controls are used in MenuViewActivity to gracefully handle the case where a menu is requested but no menu with that ID exists

Validation is used when a user account is validated, and also when dish and ingredients are saved. If the name of the dish or ingredient is empty then the save is blocked until a user enters a valid dish or ingredient name

Security is demonstrated by the user having to log into the system in order to access any information

The system is scalable in that any number of dishes or ingredients can be added
